# RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**INTRODUCTION**
This project implements a Database Management System (DBMS) designed to modernize 
operations in a restaurant, replacing traditional pen-and-paper methods and disjointed digital 
records. The system aims to resolve common challenges in areas such as order handling, inventory 
tracking, payment processing, and staff coordination. Ultimately, the system promotes smoother 
workflows and enables more responsive customer service.

**Uses of This Project:** 
This project can be used for: 
o Real-time order tracking from kitchen to billing. 
o Automated inventory updates with supplier integration. 
o Unified customer/payment records to enhance service. 
o Digital backups and security to protect business data. 
o Synchronizes operations between kitchen staff, waiters, and billing, reducing delays and 
confusion. 
o Enables quick updates to menu items and prices across all connected systems in real-time. 
By implementing a digital database solution, the system significantly improves operational 
accuracy, enhances efficiency, and establishes a robust platform for business expansion.
